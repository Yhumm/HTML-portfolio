<h1>
    The Best Movies According to Yomi
</h1>

<h2>
    My top 3 series of all time
</h2>

<hr />

<h3>
    911 Lone Star
</h3>
<p>
    I love it together with it's stand alone 911
</p>

<h3>
    Criminal Minds
</h3>
<p>
    Honestly, this is just in a whole different category of its own, hard to explain, you just have to watch it
</p>

<h3>
    Power
</h3>
<p>
    I wanted to put Empire but that lost its touch after season 3, but power has aways been on a whole differnet level
    without reducing its quality
